# swift-cli

Use Swift with Xcode in a Makefile-based project.

This is early days yet and I intend to continue experimenting over the next few days. The goal is to make something useful that links to a bunch of C libraries such as libuv and SDL.

## Usage

  * Install the Xcode 6 beta into `/Applications`
  * `make`

The path to `swift` is currently hardcoded in the Makefile.

## REPL

If you run `swift` from the command line it drops you straight into a REPL. Cool? Cool.
